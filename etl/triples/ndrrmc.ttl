    :remarks """The Lenten Season or Semana Santa is a significant annual religious observance for the Filipino Roman Catholics. It
begins on Palm Sunday and continues on through Easter Sunday. During this season, people go to churches to attend
mass to reflect and offer prayers.
Also, Catholics observe Spanish-influenced rituals such as processions, passion plays (senakulo), and pabasa. It is also
an opportunity for families to spend time together.
Easter Sunday culminates the celebration of Semana Santa, viewed as the greatest feast of the Church year. It is one of
the most festive events, a day of joy, and celebration for the faithful commemorating Jesus Christ's resurrection from the
dead.
SPECIAL WEATHER OUTLOOK ON THE OBSERVANCE OF SEMANA SANTA 2024
(25 -31 March 2024)
The Easterlies will be the dominant weather system to affect the country throughout the outlook period.
On 25 March 2024, Easterlies will bring cloudy skies with scattered rainshowers and thunderstorms over Bicol Region,
Eastern Visayas and Caraga. This weather condition will gradually move northward, affecting the provinces of Quezon
and Aurora by Tuesday (26 March). Meanwhile, Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy,
with the possibility of isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms.
For the rest of the outlook period (27 - 31 March), generally fair weather condition is expected over the whole country
apart from isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms mostly over the eastern section.
The public is advised to lessen their physical outdoor activities between 12:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon when temperatures
are at their highest. Otherwise, drink water regularly, stay and rest in shaded areas from time to time, and wear light-
colored clothing to avoid experiencing fatigue, heat cramps and heat exhaustion.""" ;

Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest). This means that there is probable magmatic intrusion that may or may not lead to an
eruption. The public was reminded that the Main Crater should be strictly off-limits because sudden steam explosions can
occur and high concentrations of lethal volcanic gases can be released.
At 4:00 PM, the alert status of Taal was raised from Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) to Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest).
This means that there is magmatic intrusion that is likely driving the current activity. The public was reminded that the
entire Volcano Island is a Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ), and entry into the island as well as high-risk barangays of
Agoncillo and Laurel is prohibited.
At 5:30 PM, eruptive activity at Taal Volcano Main Crater intensified as continuous eruption generated a taal 10-15
kilometer steam-laden tephra column with frequent volcanic lightning that rained wet ashfall on the general north as far as
Quezon City. Volcanic tremor was recorded continuously since 11:00 AM and two (2) volcanic earthquakes of magnitude
M2.5 and M3.9 were felt at Intensity III in Tagaytay City and Alitagtag, Batangas were recorded at 6:15 and 6:22 PM,
respectively.
As of 12 January 2020, 7:30 PM, the alert level of Taal Volcano was raised from Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest) to Alert
Level 4 (hazardous eruption imminent). This means that hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days.
DOST-PHIVOLCS strongly reiterates total evacuation of Taal Volcano Island and additional evacuation of areas at high
risk to pyroclastic density currents and volcanic tsunami within a 14-kilometer radius from Taal Main Crater. Areas in the
general north of Taal Volcano were advised to guard against the effects of heavy and prolonged ashfall. Civil aviation
authorities must advise aircraft to avoid the airspace around Taal Volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from
the eruption column pose hazards to aircraft.
The Taal Volcano Network (TVN) plotted a total of 2,484 volcanic earthquakes as of 13 February 2020.""" ;

Mindoro with 20 men onboard and loaded with 800,000 liters of Industrial Fuel Oil. At 4:20 AM, the stranded crews were
rescued by MV EFES, a foreign vessel, and have been reported to be in good physical condition.
On 01 March 2023, MT Princess Empress was declared totally submerged by the PCG Team upon negative sightings of
the said vessel during a seaborne and aerial search.
The Search and Rescue Team of Coast Guard Sub Station Calapan together with Special Operations Unit (SOU) Oriental
Mindoro and Marine Environmental Protection Unit (MEPU) proceeded to the area of the incident to locate the submerged
vessel. However, the operation was unsuccessful due to inclement weather conditions.
Further, Coast Guard Station Oriental Mindoro coordinated with the owner of the submerged vessel for the actions to be
undertaken regarding the incident. An aerial inspection was also conducted around the vicinity of the incident. Upon the
conduct of the said inspection, a visible oil sheen in the vicinity waters of Oriental Mindoro was sighted in the area.
On March 3, 2023, at around 5:30 in the afternoon, the residents spotted and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)
confirmed the occurrences of the oil spill along the shorelines of Barangay Tinogboc in Semirara Island, Caluya, Antique.
On 05 March 2023, oil slick sightings were reported to have reached the Islands of Quiniluban and Agutaya in the
Municipality of Agutaya, Palawan. Caluya MDRRMO also reported that the oil spill already spread in 3 Barangays namely;
Barangay Sibolo (Liwagao Island), Barangay Tinogboc and Semirara in Semirara Island.
On 06 March 2023, BRP Hydrographer Ventura may have detected the possible site where the submerged MT Princess
Empress is located. The site is about 1,200 feet or approximately 400 meters below sea level. It is located about
Northeast of Pola, Oriental Mindoro but it is believed to have moved Southeast from its last known position where it
completely submerged. However, this will require verification through the deployment of a remotely-operated vehicle
(ROV) for the complete visualization. Caluya MDRRMO also reported that the oil spill already spread in 3 Barangays
namely; Barangay Sibolo (Liwagao Island), Barangay Tinogboc and Semirara in Semirara Island.
On 20 March 2023, Japanese salvage vessel ‘Shin Nichi Maru’ carrying the Remotely-Operated Vehicle (ROV) arrived
at the port of Calapan, Oriental Mindoro and deployed the ROV. Oil slick have been observed in the vicinity waters of
Barangays San Agapito and San Agustin Verde Island, Batangas City.
On 21 March 2023, the ROV located the sunken MT Princess Empress and conducted assessment for possible
damages.
On 01 April 2023, specialized bags from United Kingdom arrived in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. These specialized
bags will be used for bagging method to seal off the leaks from the sunken MT Princess Empress.
On April 02, 2023, Dynamic Positioning Vessel (DPV) PACIFIC VALKYRIE equipped with Remotely Operated
Underwater Vehicle (ROV) HYDROS arrived in Oriental Mindoro. The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving
(SUPSALV) contracted the DPV to conduct thorough surveys and three-dimensional mapping of MT Princess Empress.
DPV PACIFIC VALKYRIE will execute remedial measures to mitigate the oil release coming from the sunken motor
tanker using ROV HYDROS. ROV HYDROS is a 2,000-pound ROV designed to meet the rapid deployable salvage
requirements to a maximum performance depth of up to 5,000 feet. The control system has an ROV dynamic positioning
capability enabling the vehicle to dive via computer instruction allowing hands-free position keeping, auto-translate
movement, following pre-programmed routes, and go-to-position functions.
The Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (DENR) has reported the results of the water quality testing
conducted across thirty five (35) sampling stations in the municipality of Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro and its

Barangays. The results released last April 14, 2023 shows that only 9 sampling stations have met the criteria for the water
quality guidelines set by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Administrative Order 2016-08 or
the Water Quality Guidelines and General Effluent Standards of 2016.
The RDRRMCs CALABARZON, MIMAROPA and VI conducted oil containment and collected oil waste on the shores in
the following affected areas:
CALABARZON
-240 liters of oily mixture
-59 sacks of oil contaminated debris and 38 liters of tar balls were collected since Day 1.
MIMAROPA
- 47,596.30 liters of oily water mixture (offshore operations)
- 6,898 sacks and 22 drums of oil contaminated debris
- 547.5 drums
- 71 tonner bags
Based on Rapid Assessment by DENR Biodiversity Management Bureau from 06-10 March 2023, the total Habitat area
affected are the following:
1. Corals: 2,251.95 Hectares
2. Seagrass: 1,040.66 Hectares
3. Mangroves: 1,604.23 Hectares
REGION VI
The breakdown of affected mangrove areas is as follows:
? 3,000 square meters (approximately) at Barangay Semirara
? 21,000 square meters (approximately) at Barangay Tinogboc
A total of 24,000 square meters approximately of affected mangroves in the Municipality of Caluya.
The oil spill primarily impacted common mangrove species, namely Avicennia sp., Rhizophora sp., and Sonneratia sp. In
addition, defoliation was observed in Sitio Sabang, located in Barangay Tinogboc. Staining was detected on the trunks of
the most affected trees, covering up to 20% of their surface. However, it is important to note that no health risks were
identified as a result of the staining, and physical clean-up operations were deemed unnecessary. Moreover, recent water
quality monitoring conducted by DENR EMB Region VI at all sampling points in the three barangays showed past results
based on DENR DAO.
According to scientific approaches utilized for shoreline assessment, cleanup operations, and laboratory analysis of oil
content, it is evident that the cleanup operation has yielded successful results. The current environmental condition in the
affected area is showing signs of recovery, with the resurgence of macro-organisms and marine life, as compared to the
initial impact of the oil spill.
Throughout the entire duration of the cleanup operation, a significant amount of oil-contaminated materials has been
successfully recovered. Specifically, one hundred forty-nine thousand five hundred forty (149,540) kilograms of oil-
contaminated materials were meticulously collected. This included approximately one hundred fifty-five thousand four
hundred sixty (155,460) kilograms of oil-contaminated sand, demonstrating the extent of contamination addressed during
the cleanup effort. Moreover, approximately three thousand forty-five (3,045) liters of an oily water mixture were also
carefully gathered, underscoring the comprehensive nature of the cleanup operation.
These findings serve as a testament to the efficacy of the undertaken measures and provide tangible evidence of the
positive progress achieved. The environmental condition in the affected area is gradually improving, as indicated by the
visible return of macro-organisms and marine life. This resurgence signifies the resilience of the ecosystem and offers
hope for the future recovery of the environment.
By employing scientific methodologies in shoreline assessment, implementing effective cleanup operations, and
conducting thorough laboratory analyses of oil content, the cleanup efforts have successfully mitigated the immediate
impacts of the oil spill. The quantities of oil-contaminated materials recovered and the observed revival of macro-
organisms and marine life in the area are positive indicators of the ongoing environmental recovery process.
On 181100H June 2023 together with all agency concerns in response agreed to terminate the response based on the
set endpoints on its segment. However, continued extraction of contaminated waste will be monitored by PCG and
continued monitoring of the site will be conducted by EMB, DENR, BFAR, and PCG .""" ;

    :remarks """Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 1 issued on 04 July 2023, PAGASA’s climate monitoring and analyses indicated
that the unusual warming of sea surface temperatures along the equatorial Pacific that was established in March 2023
has further developed into a weak El Niño.
June 2023 Assessment:
- Below to near normal rainfall conditions were observed in most parts of the country except in the provinces of La Union,
Batanes, southern Palawan, Bohol, Southern Leyte, Camiguin, Agusan del Sur and Davao Region, which received above
normal rainfall.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 2 issued on 03 August 2023, the warmer than average sea surface temperature
anomalies across most of the central and eastern equatorial Pacific signified that a weak El Niño is present and may
strengthen into moderate to strong towards the latter part of the year.
July 2023 Assessment
- Near to above normal rainfall conditions were experienced in most parts of Luzon, except for Nueva Viscaya and Quirino
which received below normal rainfall conditions. Meanwhile, Visayas and Mindanao received below to near normal rainfall
except for the provinces of Guimaras, Davao del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Dinagat Islands and Surigao del Sur where
above normal rainfall was observed.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 3 issued on 05 September 2023, an increased positive sea surface temperature
anomaly (SSTA) was observed across the tropical Pacific, indicating a moderate El Niño.
August 2023 Assessment
- Most parts of Northern Luzon, most of the Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, most of Davao Region, Caraga, and
BARMM received near to above normal rainfall.
- Below to way below-normal rainfall conditions were experienced over most parts of MIMAROPA, CALABARZON, and
Bicol Region, some parts of Eastern Visayas, and the rest of Mindanao.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 4 issued on 05 October 2023, The tropical Pacific still shows warmer-than-normal
sea surface temperatures signifying a moderate El Niño.
September 2023 Assessment
- Most parts of the country received near to above normal rainfall except Kalinga, Apayao, Ilocos Norte, Batanes,
Cagayan, Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Oriental Mindoro, Occidental Mindoro, Palawan, Camarines Sur, Guimaras, and
Lanao del Norte provinces.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 5 issued on 07 November 2023, a moderate-to-strong El Niño was present in the
tropical Pacific, showing signs of further intensification in the coming months as SSTAs reach more than 1.5degC.
October 2023 Assessment
- Most parts of the country received near normal to below normal rainfall conditions except Nueva Ecija, which received
way below normal rainfall.
- Above normal rainfall condition was observed in Ilocos Norte, Batanes, Camarines Norte, Capiz and Davao City.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 6 issued on 06 December 2023, a strong El Niño was present in the tropical Pacific
and further intensified as SSTAs have reached more than 1.5degC
November 2023 Assessment
- Way below to below normal rainfall conditions were experienced in most parts of Northern and Central Luzon, Metro

Manila, Cavite, Rizal, Occidental Mindoro, Palawan and few provinces in Visayas and Mindanao.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 7 issued on 05 January 2024, a strong El Niño was ongoing and was expected to
continue through January-February 2024.
December 2023 Assessment
- Way below to below normal rainfall conditions were experienced in most parts of the country except Bulacan, Quezon,
Bohol, Siquijor, Southern Leyte, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Davao Region, Caraga, and were near
normal rainfall were observed. Consequently, above-normal rainfall conditions were observed over Batanes and Agusan
del Norte.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 8 issued on 06 February 2024, a strong El Niño is expected to continue through
February 2024. The majority of global climate models suggest that El Niño will likely persist until the March-April-May
2024 season, with a transition to ENSO-neutral conditions expected in the April-May-June 2024 season.
January 2024 Assessment
- Way below to below normal rainfall conditions were experienced in most parts of Luzon, Visayas and Northern
Mindanao while near to above normal rainfall were observed in the provinces of Pampanga, Tarlac, Bicol Region and the
rest of Mindanao.
Per PAGASA's El Niño Advisory No. 9 issued on 07 March 2024, El Niño across the tropical Pacific Ocean shows signs
of weakening and is expected to persist until March-April-May (MAM) 2024 season. Majority of climate models suggest a
transition to ENSO-neutral conditions during the April-May-June (AMJ) 2024 season (79% chance). However, there is a
likelihood for La Niña to develop (55% chance) during the June-July-August (JJA) 2024 season. With this development,
the PAGASA ENSO Alert and Warning System is now raised to La Niña Watch.
February 2024 Assessment
- Generally way below to below normal rainfall conditions were experienced in most parts of the country except in some
areas in Mindanao, where near to above normal rainfall conditions were observed.
Per PAGASA's El Niño Advisory No. 10 issued on 05 April 2024, El Niño across the tropical Pacific Ocean continues to
weaken and is expected to persist until March-April-May (MAM) 2024 season. Majority of climate models suggest a
transition to ENSO-neutral conditions during the April-May-June (AMJ) 2024 season (83% chance). Further, there is a
likelihood for La Niña to develop (62% chance) during the June-July-August (JJA) 2024 season. As such, the PAGASA
ENSO Alert and Warning System remains at El Niño Advisory / La Niña Watch.
March 2024 Assessment
- Way below to below normal rainfall conditions were experienced in the country except in the most parts of central Luzon,
Quirino, and Pangasinan where near normal to above normal rainfall conditions were observed.
Per PAGASA's El Niño Advisory No. 11 issued on 06 May 2024, El Niño in the tropical Pacific Ocean continues to
weaken but impacts such as hotter and drier conditions still persist. A transition to ENSO-neutral conditions is anticipated
during the April-May-June (AMJ) to May-June-July (MJJ) 2024 season. However, a likelihood for La Niña to develop
during the June-July-August (JJA) 2024 season has a 60% chance. With these conditions, the PAGASA ENSO Alert and
Warning System still remains at El Niño Advisory / La Niña Watch.
April 2024 Assessment
-Way below to below normal rainfall conditions were experienced throughout the country except for the provinces of
Bulacan and Sarangani, where near normal rainfall conditions were observed.
Per PAGASA’s El Niño Advisory No. 12 (FINAL) issue on 04 June 2024, El Niño in the tropical Pacific Ocean has ended,
as both oceanic and atmospheric indicators have returned to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-neutral levels.
Moreover, a transition from ENSO-neutral to La Niña conditions remains likely (about 69% chance) by the July-August-
September 2024 season. With these developments, this is the final advisory for El Niño (2023-2024). The DOST-
PAGASA ENSO Alert and Warning System is now lowered to Inactive (ENSO-neutral) while the La Niña Watch remains
in effect.
May 2024 Assessment
-Generally way-below to below-normal rainfall conditions were experienced in Palawan, Mindanao, portions of Cagayan,
Albay, and Central Luzon, and most parts of Visayas.
-Four (4) provinces in Luzon, twelve (12) provinces in the Visayas, and ten (10) provinces in Mindanao experienced""" ;

Cloudy skies with occasional to frequent rains over the eastern section of Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao as “PAENG”
moves closer to the landmass of Eastern Visayas – Bicol region today (October 28) becoming stormy weather tomorrow
and Sunday (October 29-30) as it traverses the Central and Southern Luzon including Metro Manila.
On Monday next week (October 31), Luzon will still have occasional to frequent rains becoming stormy over Northern
Luzon as “PAENG” continues to move northward towards the Taiwan area. Gradual improvement of weather on Tuesday
(November 01) as “PAENG” move farther away from the landmass of Luzon.
Floods and landslides are expected in low-lying and in mountainous areas respectively.

(KVO-LCC) and as far away as Murcia, Negros Occidental and Bacolod City.
In view thereof, DOST-PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level of Kanlaon Volcano from Alert Level 1 (abnormal) to Alert Level
2 (increasing unrest). This means that there is current unrest driven by shallow magmatic processes that could eventually
lead to further explosive eruptions or even precede hazardous magmatic eruptions.
Explosive activity at Kanlaon on 3 June 2024 was immediately succeeded by profuse degassing from the summit crater
that waned by 8:20 AM on 4 June 2024 based on camera monitors. Post-eruptive degassing likely entrained volcanic ash
that fell as light ashfall on the southwest sector of the volcano as reported by a KVO-LCC survey team. As of 04 June,
12:00 NN, a total of 84 weak low-frequency volcanic earthquakes events have been recorded by the KVN, consistent with
current low-level degassing from the Kanlaon crater. SO2 emission measured by campaign survey has reached 4,113
tonnes/day, the highest flux this year and the second highest ever measured from Kanlaon.
Kanlaon occasionally exhibits phreatic and short-lived explosive eruptions that produce small-magnitude hazards. Of the
43 eruptions recorded since 1866 including this most recent one, only the 1902 eruption was magmatic and associated
with the generation of small-volume lava flows on the upper slopes.
On 09 September 2024, 11:30 PM, DOST-PHIVOLCS issued a notice of increased seismic activity at Kanlaon Volcano. A
total of twenty-five (25) volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes have been recorded by the Kanlaon Volcano Network since
8:32 AM this morning, with the last 22 having been recorded beginning 10:35 PM this evening. Canlaon City, Negros
Oriental residents report that at least five of these earthquakes were felt. VT earthquakes are generated by rock fracturing
processes and the increase in VT activity may possibly precede eruptive activity.
On 10 September 2024, 11:00 AM, DOST-PHIVOLCS issued a notice of increased seismic activity at Kanlaon Volcano. A
total of two hundred eighty-eight (288) volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes have been recorded by the Kanlaon Volcano
Network since 08:30 PM of 09 September 2024. The events were generated between 0 to 9 kilometers depths beneath
the north-eastern flanks of the volcanic edifice and the strongest events were felt at Intensity II in some barangays of
Canlaon City, Negros Oriental. Rumbling sounds were reported by some residents of Bago City. Strong sulfur fumes have
been reported in a few barangays in Bago, La Carlota and Canlaon Cities. VT earthquakes are generated by rock
fracturing processes and the increase in VT activity strongly indicates progressive rock-fracturing beneath the volcano as
rising magma drives a path towards the surface.
At 7:00 pm, DOST-PHIVOLCS issued a notice of elevated volcanic SO2 gas flux at Kanlaon Volcano. Volcanic sulfur
dioxide (SO2) gas emission from the summit crater of Kanlaon based on campaign Flyspec measurements today, 10
September 2024, averaged 9,985 tonnes/day. This is the highest emission from the volcano recorded since instrumental
gas monitoring began. Kanlaon has been degassing increased concentrations of volcanic SO2 this year at an average
rate of 1,273 tonnes/day prior to the 3 June 2024 eruption, but emission since then has been particularly elevated at a
current average of 3,468 tonnes/day. Sulfuric odors were reported in the following localities; Brgy. Ilijan, Bago City; Brgy.
Ara-al and Brgy. San Miguel, La Carlota City; Brgy. Masulog, Brgy. Linothangan and Brgy. Pula, Canlaon City.
The Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) still prevails over Kanlaon, but that current activity may lead to eruptive unrest and

an increase in the Alert Level.

    :remarks """The Holiday Season, encompassing both Christmas and New Year celebrations, is a period of heightened activity across
the Philippines. Traditionally, many families travel to their provinces to reunite with loved ones, underscoring the cultural
significance of this festive period. Christmas is observed through practices such as Simbang Gabi, Noche Buena, and gift-
giving, reflecting the deeply rooted spiritual and familial values of Filipino society.
New Year’s Eve celebrations are marked by widespread use of fireworks and other noise-making activities, which are
integral to Filipino customs symbolizing the drive to ward off misfortune and welcome prosperity. However, these
practices also pose safety risks, with incidents of fireworks-related injuries expected during this time.
Per PAGASA Special Weather Outlook for Christmas 2024, issued on 23 December 2024, the weather systems that are
expected to affect most parts of the country during the Christmas Holidays are the Northeast Monsoon or Amihan, the
Shear Line, and the Easterlies.
On 24 December 2024, cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms will be experienced over Metro Manila,
CALABARZON, Bicol Region, MIMAROPA, Eastern Visayas, Aurora, Aklan, and Capiz due to Shear Line. The Northeast
Monsoon will bring cloudy skies with light rains over Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley, and Cordillera Administrative Region
(CAR) while partly cloudy skies with isolated light rains will prevail over Ilocos Region. Mindanao and the rest of Visayas
will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms.
On 25 December, the Shear line will continue to bring cloudy skies and scattered rains and thunderstorms over Metro
Manila, Central Luzon, CALABARZON, Bicol Region, Northern Samar, Eastern Samar, Samar, Occidental Mindoro,
Marinduque, and Romblon. Cagayan Valley and Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) will be mostly cloudy with
scattered light rains while partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated light rains will prevail over Ilocos Region. Caraga and
Davao Region will have mostly cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms due to Easterlies. The rest of the
archipelago will experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with localized rainshowers or thunderstorms.
Strong to Gale-force winds associated with the Northeast Monsoon will prevail over Northern Luzon and the eastern
section of Central and Southern Luzon which may result to rough to very rough sea conditions. Moderate to strong
northeasterlies to easterlies may affect the western section of Luzon and the eastern section of the country while light to
moderate winds are expected over the rest of the archipelago.""" ;

the Sangguniang Barangay, along with 7 SK councilors in their respective barangay.
Originally scheduled for May 2022, the elections were rescheduled to December 2022 due to the enactment of RA 11462
in July 2019. This extension of the B/SK officials' term to 5 years was deemed necessary by the legislative branch to
provide more time for project implementation. In June 2022, RA 11935 was enacted, moving the BSK elections to
October 2023.
Winners of the 2023 BSK elections will serve until 2025, with subsequent elections held every three years.""" ;

    :remarks """On 09 December 2024, an explosive eruption occurred at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano from 3:03 PM to 3:10 PM.
The eruption produced a voluminous plume that rapidly rose to 4,000 meters above the vent and was bent and drifted by
strong winds to the west-southwest. Pyroclastic density currents or PDCs descended the slopes on the general
southeastern edifice based on IP and thermal camera monitors.
Ashfall was reported over a wide area west of the volcano while pyroclastic density currents or PDCs, hazardous mixtures
of hot volcanic gas, ash, and fragmented rock, were generated at the base of the eruption column and descended the
south-southeastern sides of the edifice based on camera monitors. The longest descent of the PDCs from the summit
crater was estimated to be approximately 2 to 3.4 kilometers in Masolog, La Castellana, still within the four kilometer
radius of the Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ).
In view thereof, DOST-PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level of Kanlaon Volcano from Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) to
Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest). This means magmatic eruption have begun that may progress to further explosive
eruptions. All local government units are advised to evacuate the 6-km radius from the summit of the volcano and must be
prepared for additional evacuation if activity warrants.
On 08 April 2025, 5:51 AM, a moderately explosive eruption occurred at the summit crater of Kanlaon Volcano. This
lasted for 56 minutes based on seismic and visual recordings and generated a gray voluminous plume that slowly rose to
4,000 meters above the vent before bending and drifting west and southwest. Audible rumbling sounds of the eruption
was reported. PDCs descended the southern slopes within a kilometer of the crater, in the jurisdiction of La Castellana,
based on visual and thermal camera monitoring. Large ballistic fragments were also observed to have been thrown
around the crater within a few hundred meters and caused burning of vegetation near the volcano summit. Thin ashfall
has been reported in some areas of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental.
Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest) still remains over Kanlaon Volcano. This means that the explosive eruption may be
followed by similar short-lived explosive eruptions in the short term or even progress to lava eruptions that generate lava
flows and lava fountaining activity.

    :hasType :GroundMovement ;
    :remarks """On 05 June 2023, the alert status of Mayon Volcano was raised to Alert Level 2 (Increasing Unrest) following a sharp
increase in the incidence of rockfall from its summit lava dome from an average of 5 events per day in May 2023 to 49
events per day on 5 June 2023.
Days of increased incidence and volume of rockfall based on seismic records were followed by the generation of short
pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) or “uson” in the morning of 08 June 2023. The PDCs were emplaced on the Bonga
(Legazpi City), Miisi (Daraga) and Basud (Sto. Domingo) Gullies as far as two (2) kilometers from the summit crater. This
indicated that new, less degassed lava was already being spalled from the summit dome and that eruption of very slowly
extruding magma had slightly increased.
On 08 June 2023, 12:00 PM, Alert Level 3 (Increased Tendency Towards Hazardous Eruption) was raised. In the evening
thereof, incandescent rockfall generated by intermittent collapse of an apparent fluidal lava portion of the summit dome
were deposited on the above gullies within a kilometer of the crater.
Fair crater glow or “banaag” and incandescent rockfall shed from new fluidal lava at the summit of Mayon Volcano was
observed on the night of 10 June 2023.
On 11 June 2023, at around 7:47 PM, lava flow activity commenced from the summit crater of Mayon Volcano. The
activity formed two lobes of lava that emplaced within 500 meters from the crater and shed lava debris on the Mi-Isi
(south) and Bonga (southeastern), and Basud (eastern) Gullies that fell within 2 kilometers from the crater. This
development was accompanied by only weak seismic activity and a slight swelling of the upper portions of the edifice
prior to lava flow based on electronic tilt data.
From 11 to 25 June 2023, very slow effusion of lava from the summit crater emplaced lava flow and collapsed debris on
the Mi-isi (south) and Bonga (southeastern) gullies. During this period, the lava flows have advanced to maximum lengths
of 2,500 meters from the summit while collapse debris have deposited up to 3,300 meters from the crater. Volcanic
earthquakes, rockfall events, and PDCs have also been observed during the period.
On 26 June 2023, 4:00 PM, there was an increased seismic activity and ground deformation in Mayon Volcano. Eruptive
activity has been dominated by weak aseismic effusion of degassed lava from the summit crater. However, an increasing
number of weak and shallow volcanic earthquakes began on 24 June 2023 and steadily increased to 102 volcanic
earthquakes during a 24-hour between 25 and 26 June 2023. Between 5:00 AM and 3:00, 26 June 2023, additional 100
volcanic earthquakes were recorded. The increased seismicity was accompanied by a noticeable sharp jump in ground tilt
on the southwest sector of the edifice that began on 25 June 2023.
On 30 June 2023, eruptive activity at Mayon Volcano was dominated by the generation of dome-collapse PDCs on the
Basud Gully on the eastern slopes. The largest of these events occurred at 1:01 PM and lasted eight (8) minutes based
on the seismic record. Four (4) visible PDCs between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM that lasted approximately four (4) minutes
each traveled 3 to 4 kilometers downslope of the Basud Gully and generated one (1) kilometer-tall ash clouds that drifted
to the north and northwest. Ashfall was recorded to have fallen on Tabaco City.
On 10 July 2023, PDCs were generated by partial collapses from the summit lava dome and the advancing front and
margins of lava flows and traveled one to three minutes within four kilometers of the Basud, Mi-isi, and Bonga Gulleys.
Thin ashfall was reported in some areas of Brgy. Mabinit, Legazpi City, Brgy. Budiao and Brgy. Salvacion, Daraga, and
Camalig, Albay.
On 21 July 2023, 10:00 AM, a Lahar Advisory for Mayon Volcano was issued based on Weather Advisory No. 5 of 20 July
2023, 11:00 AM. The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has
estimated a Low Pressure Area (LPA) exists approximately 700 km east of Borongan, Eastern Samar which will bring

cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms across the Bicol Region including Albay Province. It is further
expected that the LPA will develop into a Tropical Depression (TD) named “EGAY” which can bring moderate to heavy
rain between Sunday (23 July 2023) and Monday (24 July 2023). Due to this development, communities in predetermined
areas with lahar hazards from Mayon Volcano are strongly recommended to be vigilant and ready. The incoming tropical
depression is expected to bring about prolonged and heavy rainfall which may generate syn-eruption lahars along major
channels draining the Mayon Volcano edifice by incorporating loose material from thick pyroclastic density current (PDC)
deposits and ashfall from the ongoing 2023 eruption. The bulk of erodible PDC deposits currently occupy the watershed
areas of the Mi-isi, Bonga and Basud Channels. In addition, older and erodible eruption deposits occupy the watershed
areas on the eastern and western slopes of the edifice and can be remobilized as non-eruption lahars by erosion of banks
and channel beds. Mayon lahars can threaten communities along the middle and lower slopes and downstream of these
channels with inundation, burial, and wash away.
At 7:56 PM, short-lived lava ejection also occurred that lasted 28 seconds accompanied by seismic and infrasound
signals. In total, twenty-two (22) LFVQs including one (1) ashing and one (1) short-lived lava ejection, as well as four (4)
PDCs and one hundred seventy-five (175) rockfall events, were recorded by the Mayon Volcano Network. Volcanic sulfur
dioxide (SO2) emission averaged 1,758 tonnes/day on 21 July 2023.
From 01 July to 04 October 2023, very slow effusion of lava from the summit crater of Mayon Volcano continued to feed
lava flows and collapse debris on the Mi-isi (south) and Bonga (southeastern) gullies. During this period, the lava flows
have advanced to maximum lengths of 2,800 meters from the summit while collapse debris have deposited up to 4,000
meters from the crater. Volcanic earthquakes, rockfall events, and PDCs have also been observed during the period.
At approximately 6:00 PM, 31 July 2023, eruptive activity at Mayon became dominated by phases of intermittent ashing
alongside increases in the apparent rates of lava effusion from the summit crater. The ashing phases lasted 1 to 43
minutes and consisted of 1 to 16 discrete events recorded as low-frequency volcanic earthquakes or LFVQs of typical 30
seconds to 1 minute and 17 seconds duration.
On 08 December 2023, 8:00 AM, a notice for the lowering of Mayon Volcano’s status from Alert Level 3 (decreased
tendency towards hazardous eruption) to Alert Level 2 (moderate level of unrest) was released by DOST-PHIVOLCS.
Mayon Volcano’s monitoring network and observation of day-to-day conditions have recorded a general decline in unrest
since November 2023.
However, the lowering of the alert status should not be interpreted to mean that the volcano’s unrest has ceased,
considering that the edifice is still inflated and SO2 emission remains high relative to baseline levels.""" ;
