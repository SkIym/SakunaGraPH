    :remarks """The Lenten Season or Semana Santa is a significant annual religious observance for the Filipino Roman Catholics. It
begins on Palm Sunday and continues on through Easter Sunday. During this season, people go to churches to attend
mass to reflect and offer prayers.
Also, Catholics observe Spanish-influenced rituals such as processions, passion plays (senakulo), and pabasa. It is also
an opportunity for families to spend time together.
Easter Sunday culminates the celebration of Semana Santa, viewed as the greatest feast of the Church year. It is one of
the most festive events, a day of joy, and celebration for the faithful commemorating Jesus Christ's resurrection from the
dead.
SPECIAL WEATHER OUTLOOK ON THE OBSERVANCE OF SEMANA SANTA 2024
(25 -31 March 2024)
The Easterlies will be the dominant weather system to affect the country throughout the outlook period.
On 25 March 2024, Easterlies will bring cloudy skies with scattered rainshowers and thunderstorms over Bicol Region,
Eastern Visayas and Caraga. This weather condition will gradually move northward, affecting the provinces of Quezon
and Aurora by Tuesday (26 March). Meanwhile, Metro Manila and the rest of the country will be partly cloudy to cloudy,
with the possibility of isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms.
For the rest of the outlook period (27 - 31 March), generally fair weather condition is expected over the whole country
apart from isolated rainshowers or thunderstorms mostly over the eastern section.
The public is advised to lessen their physical outdoor activities between 12:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon when temperatures
are at their highest. Otherwise, drink water regularly, stay and rest in shaded areas from time to time, and wear light-
colored clothing to avoid experiencing fatigue, heat cramps and heat exhaustion.""" ;

    :remarks """On 05 June 2023, the alert status of Mayon Volcano was raised to Alert Level 2 (Increasing Unrest) following a sharp
increase in the incidence of rockfall from its summit lava dome from an average of 5 events per day in May 2023 to 49
events per day on 5 June 2023.
Days of increased incidence and volume of rockfall based on seismic records were followed by the generation of short
pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) or “uson” in the morning of 08 June 2023. The PDCs were emplaced on the Bonga
(Legazpi City), Miisi (Daraga) and Basud (Sto. Domingo) Gullies as far as two (2) kilometers from the summit crater. This
indicated that new, less degassed lava was already being spalled from the summit dome and that eruption of very slowly
extruding magma had slightly increased.
On 08 June 2023, 12:00 PM, Alert Level 3 (Increased Tendency Towards Hazardous Eruption) was raised. In the evening
thereof, incandescent rockfall generated by intermittent collapse of an apparent fluidal lava portion of the summit dome
were deposited on the above gullies within a kilometer of the crater.
Fair crater glow or “banaag” and incandescent rockfall shed from new fluidal lava at the summit of Mayon Volcano was
observed on the night of 10 June 2023.
On 11 June 2023, at around 7:47 PM, lava flow activity commenced from the summit crater of Mayon Volcano. The
activity formed two lobes of lava that emplaced within 500 meters from the crater and shed lava debris on the Mi-Isi
(south) and Bonga (southeastern), and Basud (eastern) Gullies that fell within 2 kilometers from the crater. This
development was accompanied by only weak seismic activity and a slight swelling of the upper portions of the edifice
prior to lava flow based on electronic tilt data.
From 11 to 25 June 2023, very slow effusion of lava from the summit crater emplaced lava flow and collapsed debris on
the Mi-isi (south) and Bonga (southeastern) gullies. During this period, the lava flows have advanced to maximum lengths
of 2,500 meters from the summit while collapse debris have deposited up to 3,300 meters from the crater. Volcanic
earthquakes, rockfall events, and PDCs have also been observed during the period.
On 26 June 2023, 4:00 PM, there was an increased seismic activity and ground deformation in Mayon Volcano. Eruptive
activity has been dominated by weak aseismic effusion of degassed lava from the summit crater. However, an increasing
number of weak and shallow volcanic earthquakes began on 24 June 2023 and steadily increased to 102 volcanic
earthquakes during a 24-hour between 25 and 26 June 2023. Between 5:00 AM and 3:00, 26 June 2023, additional 100
volcanic earthquakes were recorded. The increased seismicity was accompanied by a noticeable sharp jump in ground tilt
on the southwest sector of the edifice that began on 25 June 2023.
On 30 June 2023, eruptive activity at Mayon Volcano was dominated by the generation of dome-collapse PDCs on the
Basud Gully on the eastern slopes. The largest of these events occurred at 1:01 PM and lasted eight (8) minutes based
on the seismic record. Four (4) visible PDCs between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM that lasted approximately four (4) minutes
each traveled 3 to 4 kilometers downslope of the Basud Gully and generated one (1) kilometer-tall ash clouds that drifted
to the north and northwest. Ashfall was recorded to have fallen on Tabaco City.
On 10 July 2023, PDCs were generated by partial collapses from the summit lava dome and the advancing front and
margins of lava flows and traveled one to three minutes within four kilometers of the Basud, Mi-isi, and Bonga Gulleys.
Thin ashfall was reported in some areas of Brgy. Mabinit, Legazpi City, Brgy. Budiao and Brgy. Salvacion, Daraga, and
Camalig, Albay.
On 21 July 2023, 10:00 AM, a Lahar Advisory for Mayon Volcano was issued based on Weather Advisory No. 5 of 20 July
2023, 11:00 AM. The Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) has

    :remarks """On 09 December 2024, an explosive eruption occurred at the summit vent of Kanlaon Volcano from 3:03 PM to 3:10 PM.
The eruption produced a voluminous plume that rapidly rose to 4,000 meters above the vent and was bent and drifted by
strong winds to the west-southwest. Pyroclastic density currents or PDCs descended the slopes on the general
southeastern edifice based on IP and thermal camera monitors.
Ashfall was reported over a wide area west of the volcano while pyroclastic density currents or PDCs, hazardous mixtures
of hot volcanic gas, ash, and fragmented rock, were generated at the base of the eruption column and descended the
south-southeastern sides of the edifice based on camera monitors. The longest descent of the PDCs from the summit
crater was estimated to be approximately 2 to 3.4 kilometers in Masolog, La Castellana, still within the four kilometer
radius of the Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ).
In view thereof, DOST-PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level of Kanlaon Volcano from Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) to
Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest). This means magmatic eruption have begun that may progress to further explosive
eruptions. All local government units are advised to evacuate the 6-km radius from the summit of the volcano and must be
prepared for additional evacuation if activity warrants.
On 08 April 2025, 5:51 AM, a moderately explosive eruption occurred at the summit crater of Kanlaon Volcano. This
lasted for 56 minutes based on seismic and visual recordings and generated a gray voluminous plume that slowly rose to
4,000 meters above the vent before bending and drifting west and southwest. Audible rumbling sounds of the eruption
was reported. PDCs descended the southern slopes within a kilometer of the crater, in the jurisdiction of La Castellana,
based on visual and thermal camera monitoring. Large ballistic fragments were also observed to have been thrown
around the crater within a few hundred meters and caused burning of vegetation near the volcano summit. Thin ashfall
has been reported in some areas of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental.
Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest) still remains over Kanlaon Volcano. This means that the explosive eruption may be
followed by similar short-lived explosive eruptions in the short term or even progress to lava eruptions that generate lava
flows and lava fountaining activity.

evening. Due to the eastward-moving anticyclone located to the north of the tropical cyclone, it began to move west south
westward on 08 September and maintained its track for the next 24 hours. The next day, KIKO started to move west-
northwestward and reached its initial peak intensity of 195 km/h as it headed towards the Extreme Northern Luzon. By the
early morning of 10 September, due to the ongoing Eyewall Replacement Cycle (ERC), it slightly weakened to 185 km/h
but after the ERC was completed, KIKO re-intensified and reached its final peak intensity on the afternoon of the same
date with an estimated maximum sustained winds of 215 km/h. It passed very close to the east of Babuyan Islands and

began to slightly weaken and at 1:10 PM on the next day, KIKO left the PAR. KIKO brought heavy rains over Northern
Luzon. In addition, the rains recorded over some parts of Luzon were partly due to the passage of JOLINA. As KIKO
traversed over Extreme Northern Luzon, typhoon-force winds were experienced over the Babuyan Islands and Batanes
area

The Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (BSK) represent the smallest units of government in the Philippines, and an
election is scheduled for October 30, 2023, to select their officials. These elections are of paramount significance, as they
will determine the leaders of the smallest political and administrative units in the Philippines, the barangays. Barangay
officials play a pivotal role in the provision of basic services and the resolution of community disputes. Sangguniang
Kabataan officials, on the other hand, represent the interests of the youth in the barangays.
Each Barangay is led by a barangay captain, which serves as the chief executive, and is composed of 7 Barangay
Council Members and 1 Barangay Youth Council Representative (SK Chairperson). There are a total of 42,027
barangays across the country.
Simultaneously, elections will be held for the reformed Sangguniang Kabataan (youth council), which has a structure
similar to the Barangay Council. Youth aged 15 to 30 years will choose an SK chairperson, who will also be a member of
the Sangguniang Barangay, along with 7 SK councilors in their respective barangay.
Originally scheduled for May 2022, the elections were rescheduled to December 2022 due to the enactment of RA 11462
in July 2019. This extension of the B/SK officials' term to 5 years was deemed necessary by the legislative branch to
provide more time for project implementation. In June 2022, RA 11935 was enacted, moving the BSK elections to
October 2023.

    :remarks """On 03 June 2024, at 6:51 PM, a moderately explosive eruption occurred at the summit crater of Kanlaon Volcano. The
event was recorded as an E-type earthquake that lasted six (6) minutes based on seismic data and produced a five (5)
kilometer-high voluminous eruption plume. Thermal camera monitors showed material collapsing from the incandescent
plume forming pyroclastic density currents or PDCs that descended the southern slopes to a distance of two (2) to three
(3) kilometers. Incandescent ballistic ejecta were also observed to rain down from the eruption plume. Rumbling sounds
generated by the eruption were heard in La Castellana and La Carlota City, Negros Occidental and Canlaon City, Negros
Oriental. Coarse ashfall reportedly fell upon barangays of these same areas and Bago City, Negros Occidental. Sulfurous
odors were also experienced by residents in these areas as well as in Kanlaon Volcano Observatory-La Carlota City
(KVO-LCC) and as far away as Murcia, Negros Occidental and Bacolod City.
In view thereof, DOST-PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level of Kanlaon Volcano from Alert Level 1 (abnormal) to Alert Level
2 (increasing unrest). This means that there is current unrest driven by shallow magmatic processes that could eventually
lead to further explosive eruptions or even precede hazardous magmatic eruptions.
Explosive activity at Kanlaon on 3 June 2024 was immediately succeeded by profuse degassing from the summit crater
that waned by 8:20 AM on 4 June 2024 based on camera monitors. Post-eruptive degassing likely entrained volcanic ash
that fell as light ashfall on the southwest sector of the volcano as reported by a KVO-LCC survey team. As of 04 June,
12:00 NN, a total of 84 weak low-frequency volcanic earthquakes events have been recorded by the KVN, consistent with
current low-level degassing from the Kanlaon crater. SO2 emission measured by campaign survey has reached 4,113
tonnes/day, the highest flux this year and the second highest ever measured from Kanlaon.
Kanlaon occasionally exhibits phreatic and short-lived explosive eruptions that produce small-magnitude hazards. Of the
43 eruptions recorded since 1866 including this most recent one, only the 1902 eruption was magmatic and associated
with the generation of small-volume lava flows on the upper slopes.
On 09 September 2024, 11:30 PM, DOST-PHIVOLCS issued a notice of increased seismic activity at Kanlaon Volcano. A
total of twenty-five (25) volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes have been recorded by the Kanlaon Volcano Network since
8:32 AM this morning, with the last 22 having been recorded beginning 10:35 PM this evening. Canlaon City, Negros
Oriental residents report that at least five of these earthquakes were felt. VT earthquakes are generated by rock fracturing
processes and the increase in VT activity may possibly precede eruptive activity.
On 10 September 2024, 11:00 AM, DOST-PHIVOLCS issued a notice of increased seismic activity at Kanlaon Volcano. A
total of two hundred eighty-eight (288) volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes have been recorded by the Kanlaon Volcano
Network since 08:30 PM of 09 September 2024. The events were generated between 0 to 9 kilometers depths beneath
the north-eastern flanks of the volcanic edifice and the strongest events were felt at Intensity II in some barangays of
Canlaon City, Negros Oriental. Rumbling sounds were reported by some residents of Bago City. Strong sulfur fumes have
been reported in a few barangays in Bago, La Carlota and Canlaon Cities. VT earthquakes are generated by rock
fracturing processes and the increase in VT activity strongly indicates progressive rock-fracturing beneath the volcano as
rising magma drives a path towards the surface.
At 7:00 pm, DOST-PHIVOLCS issued a notice of elevated volcanic SO2 gas flux at Kanlaon Volcano. Volcanic sulfur
dioxide (SO2) gas emission from the summit crater of Kanlaon based on campaign Flyspec measurements today, 10
September 2024, averaged 9,985 tonnes/day. This is the highest emission from the volcano recorded since instrumental
gas monitoring began. Kanlaon has been degassing increased concentrations of volcanic SO2 this year at an average
rate of 1,273 tonnes/day prior to the 3 June 2024 eruption, but emission since then has been particularly elevated at a
current average of 3,468 tonnes/day. Sulfuric odors were reported in the following localities; Brgy. Ilijan, Bago City; Brgy.
Ara-al and Brgy. San Miguel, La Carlota City; Brgy. Masulog, Brgy. Linothangan and Brgy. Pula, Canlaon City.
The Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) still prevails over Kanlaon, but that current activity may lead to eruptive unrest and""" ;

Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest). This means that there is probable magmatic intrusion that may or may not lead to an
eruption. The public was reminded that the Main Crater should be strictly off-limits because sudden steam explosions can
occur and high concentrations of lethal volcanic gases can be released.
At 4:00 PM, the alert status of Taal was raised from Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) to Alert Level 3 (magmatic unrest).

entire Volcano Island is a Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ), and entry into the island as well as high-risk barangays of
Agoncillo and Laurel is prohibited.
At 5:30 PM, eruptive activity at Taal Volcano Main Crater intensified as continuous eruption generated a taal 10-15
kilometer steam-laden tephra column with frequent volcanic lightning that rained wet ashfall on the general north as far as
Quezon City. Volcanic tremor was recorded continuously since 11:00 AM and two (2) volcanic earthquakes of magnitude
M2.5 and M3.9 were felt at Intensity III in Tagaytay City and Alitagtag, Batangas were recorded at 6:15 and 6:22 PM,

Mindoro with 20 men onboard and loaded with 800,000 liters of Industrial Fuel Oil. At 4:20 AM, the stranded crews were
rescued by MV EFES, a foreign vessel, and have been reported to be in good physical condition.
On 01 March 2023, MT Princess Empress was declared totally submerged by the PCG Team upon negative sightings of
the said vessel during a seaborne and aerial search.
The Search and Rescue Team of Coast Guard Sub Station Calapan together with Special Operations Unit (SOU) Oriental
Mindoro and Marine Environmental Protection Unit (MEPU) proceeded to the area of the incident to locate the submerged
vessel. However, the operation was unsuccessful due to inclement weather conditions.
Further, Coast Guard Station Oriental Mindoro coordinated with the owner of the submerged vessel for the actions to be
undertaken regarding the incident. An aerial inspection was also conducted around the vicinity of the incident. Upon the
conduct of the said inspection, a visible oil sheen in the vicinity waters of Oriental Mindoro was sighted in the area.
On March 3, 2023, at around 5:30 in the afternoon, the residents spotted and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG)
confirmed the occurrences of the oil spill along the shorelines of Barangay Tinogboc in Semirara Island, Caluya, Antique.
On 05 March 2023, oil slick sightings were reported to have reached the Islands of Quiniluban and Agutaya in the
Municipality of Agutaya, Palawan. Caluya MDRRMO also reported that the oil spill already spread in 3 Barangays namely;
Barangay Sibolo (Liwagao Island), Barangay Tinogboc and Semirara in Semirara Island.
On 06 March 2023, BRP Hydrographer Ventura may have detected the possible site where the submerged MT Princess
Empress is located. The site is about 1,200 feet or approximately 400 meters below sea level. It is located about
Northeast of Pola, Oriental Mindoro but it is believed to have moved Southeast from its last known position where it
completely submerged. However, this will require verification through the deployment of a remotely-operated vehicle
(ROV) for the complete visualization. Caluya MDRRMO also reported that the oil spill already spread in 3 Barangays
namely; Barangay Sibolo (Liwagao Island), Barangay Tinogboc and Semirara in Semirara Island.
On 20 March 2023, Japanese salvage vessel ‘Shin Nichi Maru’ carrying the Remotely-Operated Vehicle (ROV) arrived

Barangays San Agapito and San Agustin Verde Island, Batangas City.
On 21 March 2023, the ROV located the sunken MT Princess Empress and conducted assessment for possible
damages.
On 01 April 2023, specialized bags from United Kingdom arrived in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro. These specialized
bags will be used for bagging method to seal off the leaks from the sunken MT Princess Empress.
On April 02, 2023, Dynamic Positioning Vessel (DPV) PACIFIC VALKYRIE equipped with Remotely Operated
Underwater Vehicle (ROV) HYDROS arrived in Oriental Mindoro. The U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving
(SUPSALV) contracted the DPV to conduct thorough surveys and three-dimensional mapping of MT Princess Empress.
DPV PACIFIC VALKYRIE will execute remedial measures to mitigate the oil release coming from the sunken motor
tanker using ROV HYDROS. ROV HYDROS is a 2,000-pound ROV designed to meet the rapid deployable salvage
requirements to a maximum performance depth of up to 5,000 feet. The control system has an ROV dynamic positioning
